\section{Background information}

% TODO: qualitative explanation of torque and force acting on cylinder

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ramp_incline_labelled}
    \caption{Diagram of rolling object on inclined ramp labelled with forces}
    \label{fig:ramp_labelled}
\end{figure}

Referring to Figure \ref*{fig:ramp_labelled}, the translational $F_{net}$ is given by
$$
    F_{net} = F_{\parallel} - F_f
$$
as every force in the system other than frictional force ($F_f$) and the force component of
gravitational force parallel to the incline of the ramp ($F_{\parallel}$) is being cancelled
out by some other force.

% TODO: bad explanation
The rolling object is also experiencing a torque relative to the point $P$ in Figure \ref*{fig:ramp_labelled}.
This torque is only arising from frictional force, as while $F_N$ passes through
point $P$ and $F_G$ is originating from point $P$, $F_f$ is the only force that is
creating a force that originates from some point other than $P$ and is perpendicular
to the line of the force's own origin to $P$.

Using this information, the formula for the translational acceleration of the two rolling objects
(a hollow cylinder and a solid sphere) can be derived.

\subsection{Derivation of the formula for translational acceleration of the hollow cylinder}

The moment of inertia for a hollow cylinder is $I = mr^2$. The derivation for the
translational acceleration of this cylinder is shown below.

\begin{align*}
     & \Gamma = I\alpha, ~ \Gamma = F_f r, ~ \alpha = \frac{a}{r}
    \\
     & F_f r = mr^2\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)
    \\
     & F_f = ma
    \\
    \\
     & \sin(\theta) = \frac{F_{\parallel}}{F_G}, ~ F_G = mg
    \\
     & F_{\parallel} = mg\sin(\theta)
    \\
    \\
     & F_{net} = ma
    \\
     & F_{\parallel} - F_f = ma
    \\
     & mg\sin(\theta) - ma = ma
    \\
     & a = \frac{1}{2}g\sin{\theta}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Derivation of the formula for translational acceleration of the solid sphere}

The moment of inertia for a hollow cylinder is $I = \frac{2}{5}mr^2$. The derivation for the
translational acceleration of this cylinder is shown below.

\begin{align*}
     & \Gamma = I\alpha, ~ \Gamma = F_f r, ~ \alpha = \frac{a}{r}
    \\
     & F_f r = \frac{2}{5}mr^2\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)
    \\
     & F_f = \frac{2}{5}ma
    \\
    \\
     & \sin(\theta) = \frac{F_{\parallel}}{F_G}, ~ F_G = mg
    \\
     & F_{\parallel} = mg\sin(\theta)
    \\
    \\
     & F_{net} = ma
    \\
     & F_{\parallel} - F_f = ma
    \\
     & mg\sin(\theta) - \frac{2}{5}ma = ma
    \\
     & a = \frac{5}{7}g\sin{\theta}
\end{align*}

\subsection{How the predicted time to reach the end of the ramp is calculated}

Given that we will be able to calculated the angle of inclination of the ramp using
the length and height of the ramp, we will be able to find what the translational
acceleration of the rolling object will be. Additionally, we know the incline
length of the ramp and that the initial translational velocity of the rolling object
will be zero. Since we know the values of $a, u, s$, then we can calculate the
predicted time to reach the end of the ramp.

\begin{align*}
     & s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
    \\
     & \text{Because } u = 0
    \\
     & s = \frac{1}{2}at^2
    \\
     & at^2 = 2s
    \\
     & t^2 = \frac{2s}{a}
    \\
     & t = \sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}}
\end{align*}

\section{Raw data}

\subsection{Qualitative observations}

    \label{fig:apparatus}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hollow cylinder}

Upon close inspection, the hollow cylinder does not appear to be completely circular
and is rather in a slight elliptical shape. This is assumed to be as a result of
the cylinder's malleable material.

Additionally, the cylinder has grooves and holes along the exterior of it. This may
or may not affect the frictional force of the cylinder moving down the ramp.

\subsubsection{Solid sphere}

The solid sphere, being made of foam, is soft and squishy. This may affect the
normal force of the sphere, as rather than only having on point of contact for the
normal force to originate from, the sphere will have a considerable area of contact,
in which various parts of the area of contact will have different magnitudes of
normal force.

When conducting the trials, the sphere was found to sometimes roll diagonally down the
ramp. This may be as a result of the sphere being soft and squishy, causing a larger
area of contact and potentially a normal force directed to one side or another.

The material of foam may also have a slight affect on the moment of inertia of the
sphere, as the air in the sphere may cause a slightly different distribution of mass
in the sphere.
